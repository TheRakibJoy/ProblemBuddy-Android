# ProblemBuddy Android

A native Kotlin Android app that helps Codeforces users pick their next problem.

**The core idea: learn from who you look up to.** Pick a Codeforces handle you
find inspiring — `tourist`, `jiangly`, your favorite Red — and ProblemBuddy
pulls their accepted problems into your local library. Your recommendations
are then tuned to that level, gently pushing you toward the kind of problems
they solve. It builds a local picture of your practice — solved problems, weak
topics, contest history, daily streak — and ranks the corpus against your
weaknesses. No account, no server, no tracking. Everything runs on your device.

This is the Android port of the web app at
[TheRakibJoy/ProblemBuddy](https://github.com/TheRakibJoy/ProblemBuddy) (Django +
React). Same recommendation logic, now running entirely on your phone.

Idea and original project by **[RakibJoy](https://codeforces.com/profile/RakibJoy)**.

> Release APKs are published automatically to the [`downloads`](../../tree/downloads)
> branch of this repo on every push to `main`.

## Download & install

1. On your Android phone, open the [`downloads`](../../tree/downloads) branch.
2. Tap `ProblemBuddy-latest.apk` → **Download**.
3. Open the APK. Android will prompt you to allow installs from your browser
   (one-time). Tap **Install**.

The APK is signed with a debug key, so Android shows an "unknown source" warning
— expected for side-loading. Minimum supported OS is **Android 8.0 (API 26)**.

## Screens

- **Onboarding** — enter your Codeforces handle; validated against
  `GET /api/user.info` before you can continue.
- **Home** — dashboard: upcoming contest countdown (registers via
  `contest.list`), streak-at-risk banner, rating / solved / streak stats,
  progress-to-next-tier pill, weekly goal progress, **problem of the day** card,
  today's picks, upsolve queue placeholder, "due for review" list, rotating tip.
- **Recommend** — ranked problem list with left-rail rating, tier accent bar,
  tag chips. Swipe right to open, swipe left to skip; buttons for Solve / Mark
  Solved / Skip. Filter sheet with chip-based include/exclude tag selection,
  rating range, weak-only toggle, count. Staleness banner when data is cached.
- **Train** — framed as *"learn from who you look up to"*: enter a handle you're
  inspired by and the app pulls their accepted problems into your local library,
  tuning recommendations toward that level. Shows a **corpus overview** (total
  problems, distinct tags, handle count, by-difficulty histogram), a live-
  validated handle input, progress card for the active ingest, and a list of
  previously-trained handles with re-sync / remove actions.
- **Profile** — hero with handle + tier badge + 3-stat row. Four tabs:
  1. **Tier ladder** — full vertical CF ladder, tier you're at is highlighted.
  2. **Weak tags** — coverage bars driven by `ComputeWeakTagsUseCase`.
  3. **Activity** — submissions heatmap (26 weeks), streak stats, full rating
     timeline, recent-contests list, division deltas, tier-stacked area,
     8-spoke tag radar, first-attempt AC rate, 90-day verdict breakdown,
     recently-failed problems, day-of-week + hour-of-day charts, language
     distribution, rated vs virtual counts, milestones feed, projected
     tier-ETA, one-year-ago snapshot.
  4. **Compare** — type another handle; see side-by-side rating and tier.
- **Settings** — appearance (theme), recommendations (per-load count, difficulty
  offset), goals (weekly solve target), notifications (daily problem reminder
  with time picker, hour + minute), data (reset corpus, delete all data),
  about (handle attribution + version + GitHub link).

## Key features

- **Codeforces-accurate tier colors and rating bands.** Newbie `#808080` through
  Legendary `#FF0000` match the site exactly. Legendary handles render with the
  first character in black per the CF convention.
- **Daily problem of the day** — deterministic per (date, handle), cached in
  DataStore. Same problem all day; rolls over at local midnight.
- **Daily notification** — opt-in `PeriodicWorkRequest` that fires at a user-
  chosen hour + minute via a `TimePicker`. Posts a notification with one
  recommended problem; tap opens it in the browser.
- **Spaced-repetition review queue** — when you mark a problem solved, it's
  scheduled for re-review using Leitner boxes (intervals 1 / 3 / 7 / 14 / 30 /
  90 days). Due problems surface on Home.
- **Incremental submission sync** — `user.status` is pulled in 100-item pages
  using a per-handle checkpoint, so active users don't re-download 10k+
  submissions on every refresh.
- **Offline resilience** — `userInfo`, `userStatus`, and upcoming contests are
  persisted in Room; if Codeforces is unreachable, the app falls back to cached
  data and shows a stale-data banner with age.
- **Weekly goal** — set a target, Home shows your progress against it.
- **Compare against another handle** — side-by-side rating and tier, opens the
  other user's CF profile in one tap.

## Architecture

Three layers with unidirectional data flow. MVI lives in the UI layer; domain
and data are plain Kotlin + Coroutines.

```
┌─────── UI (Compose + MVI) ────────┐
│  Screen ◀── StateFlow             │
│     │        collectAsStateWithLifecycle
│     ▼                              │
│  onIntent(Intent) ── ViewModel    │
│  Channel<Effect> ── navigation,   │
│                     toasts        │
└──────────── Domain ───────────────┘
│  UseCase: suspend invoke(): Result │
│  Pure models: Problem, Tier,       │
│  Filters, TrainingJob, Review,     │
│  ActivityStats, RatingPoint…       │
└──────────── Data ─────────────────┘
│  Repository (interface in domain)  │
│     ├── Room DAOs                  │
│     ├── Retrofit CodeforcesApi     │
│     └── DataStore<Preferences>     │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **State**: single immutable data class per screen.
- **Intent**: sealed interface covering every user action.
- **Effect**: one-shot events via `Channel` + `receiveAsFlow()` (navigation,
  toasts) — never via `StateFlow`.
- **Reducers are pure.** Side effects flow through use cases or effects.

## Recommendation algorithm

1. Handle-tier: `Tier.forMaxRating(userInfo.maxRating ?: rating ?: 0)`.
2. **Difficulty window** (actually enforced): if no explicit filter, the use
   case computes `[rating + offset − 100, rating + offset + 200]` — the
   classic CP "slightly above your rating" practice rule. Settings' difficulty
   offset shifts the window.
3. Weak tags via `ComputeWeakTagsUseCase`: `coverage = solved / corpus`,
   ascending, top 10, with a minimum corpus-count threshold so tiny tag
   buckets don't dominate.
4. `TierIndex.build(problems)` builds a bag-of-words vector per problem.
5. `rank(weakTags)` returns problem indices sorted by cosine similarity.
6. Filters applied in order: solved set, interactions (solved / skipped /
   hidden), rating window, include tags, exclude tags, `weakOnly`.
7. Take `filters.count`.

## Codeforces rating bands

Matched to the site exactly:

| Tier | Range |
| --- | --- |
| Newbie | `< 1200` |
| Pupil | `1200–1399` |
| Specialist | `1400–1599` |
| Expert | `1600–1899` |
| Candidate Master | `1900–2099` |
| Master | `2100–2299` |
| International Master | `2300–2399` |
| Grandmaster | `2400–2599` |
| International Grandmaster | `2600–2999` |
| Legendary Grandmaster | `3000+` |

Tier color is canonical Codeforces hex (gray, green, cyan, blue, magenta,
orange, red). Master/Intl Master share the same orange and GM/IGM share the
same red — as on the site. Legendary handles render their first character in
black over the red, also matching CF.

## Building locally

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug                 # debug APK (app/build/outputs/apk/debug/)
./gradlew assembleRelease               # release APK, R8 + shrink + debug-signed
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest             # unit tests (JUnit 5)
./gradlew compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin # compile Compose/Room instrumentation tests
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest     # run instrumentation tests (needs emulator)
```

Release builds enable R8 minification and resource shrinking. See
[`app/proguard-rules.pro`](app/proguard-rules.pro) for the kept classes —
kotlinx.serialization DTOs, Retrofit service interfaces (R8 full-mode recipe),
the `IngestWorker` and `DailyProblemWorker`, etc.

### Requirements

- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35 (`compileSdk`)
- Gradle 8.9 (wrapper included)

Open `settings.gradle.kts` at the repo root in Android Studio Ladybug or newer.

## Tests

Unit tests (`app/src/test/`):

- `Tier.forMaxRating` parametrised over every CF rating boundary (19+ cases).
- `TierIndex` cosine ranking with fixture corpora.
- `ComputeWeakTagsUseCase` ordering + minimum corpus-count filtering.
- `GetRecommendationsUseCase` end-to-end with mocked repositories, includes
  difficulty-offset path.
- `HandleValidator` for the shared handle regex.
- `CodeforcesMappers` — all DTO → domain fields, protocol-relative avatar URL
  normalization, `ContestDto.toUpcoming()` parsing.
- `ProblemMappers`, `TrainingJobMappers`.

Instrumentation tests (`app/src/androidTest/`):

- `RecommendScreenTest` — skeleton state, problem cards render, filter
  IconButton emits the right intent, Mark-Solved (via overflow) removes the
  card.
- `ProblemBuddyDatabaseMigrationTest` — Room v1 → v2 migration preserves
  existing rows and adds the `cached_payloads` table.

## CI

Three GitHub Actions workflows in [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows):

1. **`android.yml`** — on every push/PR to `main`:
   - Job 1: assemble debug + run unit tests + compile instrumentation tests.
   - Job 2: matrix over API levels 29 and 34, boot an emulator via
     [`reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner`](https://github.com/reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner),
     run `connectedDebugAndroidTest`. Uses AVD caching.
2. **`publish-apk.yml`** — on every push to `main` (or manual dispatch):
   - Builds the release APK.
   - Commits it to an orphan `downloads` branch as
     `ProblemBuddy-latest.apk` and `ProblemBuddy-<versionName>-<shortsha>.apk`
     plus a README.
   - `main` history stays free of binary bloat.

## Privacy

- Your Codeforces handle, corpus, interactions, reviews, and settings stay
  on-device in Room and DataStore.
- The app makes public, read-only calls to `codeforces.com/api/`. Nothing else
  leaves the device — no telemetry, no crash reporting, no analytics.

## Contributing

The single source of truth for the architecture and implementation order is
[`app/Implementation Plan.md`](app/Implementation%20Plan.md). Read it before
making non-trivial changes.

House rules (from `Implementation Plan.md` §8):

1. No `android.*` / `androidx.*` imports in `domain/`. Domain is pure Kotlin.
2. State mutates only through `_state.update { … }` inside the ViewModel
   reducer.
3. All IO/DB/network is `suspend` and dispatched to `Dispatchers.IO` at the
   repository boundary — never on the main thread.
4. `domain.model.Tier` is the only source of truth for rating thresholds.
5. One screen = one ViewModel. Share repositories, not ViewModels.
